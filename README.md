# .Net Core Blog Project

This is an application of **onion architecture**. There are four main folders named **Core**, **Infrastructure**, **Application**, **Presentation** in which there are different classes and class libraries depending on concerns. In this project, I applied the code-first approach to create the database using Entity Framework.  In the middleware, you can choose either mongodblogger or FileLogger to save requests and responses.
